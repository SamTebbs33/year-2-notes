Words contribute to the overall meaning of a sentence and the meaning of other words in that sentence.
* Homonyms: word with multiple possible meanings
* Homographs/homophones: same form/sound
* Synonyms
	* Strong symonyms: Mean exactly the same
	* Weak synonyms: Similar meaning

# Polysemy
* Homographs: (river)bank/(money)bank
* Polysemy:
	* Related but distinct senses (bake a potato / bake a cake)
* Meaning shift (over time): literal sense -> metaphor -> polysemous new sense
* Tests of polysemy
	* Etmymology: "pupil"
	* Zeugma: Usage of two meanings of one word, "He expired the same day as his TV licence", two senses of 'expired'

# Applications of WSD (Word sense disambiguation)
* Speech generation
* Speech understanding
* Information retrieval
	* Although people tend to disambigaute queries anyway ("bats" vs "cricket bats")

# Selectional restrictions
Wilks 1972

Each sense in lexicon has a set of features (HUMAN, ANIMATE, ABSTRACT, ...)
Features of one word affects sense of words in rest of sentence.

* Nouns: appropriate semantic feature
* Adjectives: Prefer features of nouns it modifies
* Verbs: Prefer features of nouns it governs
* Adverbs: Prefere features of verb
