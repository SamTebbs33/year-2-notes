# What NLP is
* searching for keywords
* Finding related concepts
* Spelling correction and text transformation

1. Sentence splitting
2. Morphological analysis/lemmatisation
3. Speech tagging
4. Chunking (When parsing is unnecessary)
5. Named entity recognition
6. Parse tree construction
7. Information extraction (dates et.c)
8. Deep semantics
