# Phrase identification
Identifying sequences of words as phrases or idioms.
Constituent words in a phrase must be analysed as a whole otherwise they make no sense (e.g "Red herring" as opposed to "red" "herring")

## Methods

Check if words are used a lot together, if they are then they could potentially make up a phrase (n-gram frequency).
Idioms can be pre-determined with a mapping between them and their meaning.

A concept could be "dog" and a certain dog is an instance of this concept.

### Wikification
