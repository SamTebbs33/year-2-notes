# Instruction set
* Set of native operations
* Programmer's view of machine
* Each opcode has two representations:
	* Machine readable binary number
	* Human-readable mnemonic
* A compiler converts code into machine-readable binary format

## Types

### Complex instruciton set/computer (CISC)
* Intel/AMD
* Rich instructions

### Reduced instruction set/computer (RISC)
* ARM/SPARC/MIPS/PowerPC
* Simple instructions
* Typically refer to "load/store" architectures

Modern CISC CPUs have RISC cores.

## Programming methodology
* Functional programming: what
* Imperative programming: what and how
* Assembly language: what, how and where (The resources available must be understood)
