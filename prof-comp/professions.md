# Professions

A profession requires education and training, and is governed by some governing body. The governing body provides guidelines and a code of conduct that its members must comply with.
To call yourself a member of and carry our the practices of a profession you must be recognised by that governing body.

Software engineers are governed by BCS, but the term "engineer" is not restricted in the UK.
